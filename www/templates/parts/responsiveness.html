            Responsiveness is crucial to modern customer experience management. As you integrate more communications tools and implement CTI, agents are no longer confined to one location. Volumes fluctuate but bottlenecks and dropped calls are as unacceptable as overspending on channels.

Advanced SIP packets deliver the data you need to manage your queue and your workforce. Audio transmission is streamlined to optimize customer experience with high-quality audio.
