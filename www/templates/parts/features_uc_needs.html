Flowroute provides account level tools you can use to build customized protection against toll-fraud right into your business VoIP service.</p>

        <h3>Disable outbound SIP credentials</h3>

        <p>If your organization is focused on very specific regions, you can build a list of allowable destinations that will block calls to anywhere else in the world.</p>
