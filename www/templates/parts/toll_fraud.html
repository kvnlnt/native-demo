            Security is a concern for any business. Flowroute provides account level tools you can use to build customized protection against toll-fraud. Disable outbound SIP credentials - By authenticating outbound calls using a strict IP address whitelist, calls originating from outside your static IPs will be blocked. Maximum outbound rate - Setting a maximum outbound rate protects your account from attackers sending calls to high-cost destinations. Destination restriction - Many toll-fraud attacks use stolen credentials to route calls to a short list of destinations. This feature lets you block destinations you know youâ€™ll never need to call. Destination whitelisting - If your organization is focused on very specific regions, you can build a list of allowable destinations that will block calls to anywhere else in the world.
