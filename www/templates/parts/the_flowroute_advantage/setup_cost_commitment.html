    <h2>The Flowroute Advantage</h2>
    <p>
        “Flowroute wins on cost, quality, and implementation speed.” Rick, Corporate Applications Manager Flowroute enterprise SIP trunking delivers new levels of efficiency. </p>

    <h4>Easy setup:</h4>
    <p>
        Our adherence to SIP RFC means Flowroute SIP trunking is broadly compatible with all SIP based platforms, so interop is simple and seamless. Creating your account takes less than 5 minutes, including configuration.</p>

    <h4>Cost efficiency:</h4>
    <p>
        Flowroute VoIP service rates are highly competitive, and that’s just the beginning of the savings you’ll see. Inbound and outbound channels scale on demand in real-time. You don’t have to overspend on trunks for rare spikes in traffic. With per-minute billing, you will only ever pay for the service you use, nothing more. </p>

    <h4>Commitment to customer success:</h4>
    <p>
        Our award-winning team of expert support engineers’ commitment to resolution has earned a 96% customer satisfaction rating. Support is free, and never tiered. We’re available on the phones 13 hours a day Monday to Friday, and via email ticket every day of the week. Because almost 90% of the calls we receive stem from issues outside of Flowroute service, we train our engineers to troubleshoot beyond our platform and examine your entire communications system.</p>
