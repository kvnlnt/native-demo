        <h2>Inbound</h2>
        <p>
            As the world’s first pure SIP carrier, Flowroute maximizes the uptime of your business VoIP system by actively finding the most reliable, highest quality path available for each call in real-time. Expanded SIP signaling exposes detailed routing intelligence so you can manage and track calls with granular control. Inbound call channels can be unlimited so that all calls get through. And you only pay for service you use, so you never overpay for trunks again. Or, you can keep costs predictable by building a pool of unlimited minutes over a fixed number of inbound channels shared by all of your phone numbers, including toll-free lines.

        <h2>Toll-fraud protections</h2>
        <p>
            Security is a concern for any business. Flowroute provides account level tools you can use to build customized protection against toll-fraud. Disable outbound SIP credentials - By authenticating outbound calls using a strict IP address whitelist, calls originating from outside your static IPs will be blocked. Maximum outbound rate - Setting a maximum outbound rate protects your account from attackers sending calls to high-cost destinations. Destination restriction - Many toll-fraud attacks use stolen credentials to route calls to a short list of destinations. This feature lets you block destinations you know you’ll never need to call. Destination whitelisting - If your organization is focused on very specific regions, you can build a list of allowable destinations that will block calls to anywhere else in the world.
